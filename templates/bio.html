	<h3>Hey guys, I'm Jess.</h3> 

	<p>
	Let me briefly introduce myself. I lift heavy stuff. And my love for lifting heavy stuff has led me to help others in their quest to live a healthy lifestyle. 
	</p>
	<p>
	My introduction to fitness ironically began in the third grade. I was in my school’s spelling bee when I received the word “dumbbell”. Not only did I misspell the word, but at 8 years old, I had no idea what a dumbbell even was. It’s safe to say that at no point in my life was health and fitness as a career, much less a passion, ever an option for me...up until about 4ish years ago... 
	</p>

	As soon as I was of legal age to serve alcohol, I became a bartender and lived the life that came along with it at a young age. I survived on booze, fast food, red bull, and had the sleeping habits of a bat. The only physical activities that were of interest to me were dancing and pool parties, and at the time nothing else, especially health and fitness, seemed of importance. 
	</p>
	<p>
	My first undying passion was for music. During my 7 years as a bartender, I worked for record labels and radio stations, and completed an apprenticeship program for audio engineering to work in a recording studio recording bands. DREAM! I never had any motivation to workout until the rite of passage in life that we all go through...a rough break-up. It’s different for everyone but thanks to that guy, I had the “I’m gonna get hot and he’ll be sorry” mentality! I started at 33% body fat, and had absolutely no muscle or physical ability to do any sort of athletic feat of strength, i.e. pushups, pull-ups, squats, NOTHING. As I saw results in body composition and strength, working out went from being an obligation, to being the best part of my day. Never saw that coming! It wasn’t until I became pregnant and had my son that I decided that I wanted fitness to be a career. Not only was it more stable than the life of a newbie audio engineer/part-time bartender, but fitness and being healthy had genuinely become something I loved to do and be!

	<p>
	And that’s how that all happened! I started my training career 4 years ago at Washington Gym, training groups ranging in size from 2-50 people to be stronger, leaner, and healthier, all while learning and becoming those things myself. I am now personal training at Studio Fitness in The Heights, and I hope to share what I have learned about working out, nutrition, meal prep, recovery, sleep habits, mobility, motivation, and EVERYTHING else, with as many people as possible! Although being “fit and healthy” is extremely important, it’s just as important to enjoy your life. I hope I can help you define what it means to you to be “fit and healthy” all while maintaining balance and more importantly happiness in your life.
